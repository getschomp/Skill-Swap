# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
   Skill.create()
   User_skill.create()
   User.create(username: , email: , password: , gender: , about_me: )
