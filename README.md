A user can edit their profile with information about what they want to know and information abou what that they already know to your profile and then search for other users that would be a good match for trading skills. This app features site wide global definitions of skills, as well as definitions of users relationships with those skills.  The app uses the geocoder gem to find users at specific distances as well as public pub, faye, asynchronous javascript and thin for realtime chatting.
